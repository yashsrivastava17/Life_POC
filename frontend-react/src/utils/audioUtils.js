// This utility module contains functions for audio processing and API calls related to audio recording.

[Write a JavaScript module that exports functions to handle audio processing (e.g., converting Blob to File) and making API calls to upload audio. Include inline comments and error handling.]

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
audioUtils.js abstracts away the details of audio file manipulation and API communication. 
This includes converting recorded audio (Blob) to a File object and uploading it (using the functions in api.js).

// Convert a Blob object to a File object
// audioUtils.js:
// Functions to handle audio processing (e.g., Blob -> File).

export const blobToFile = (blob, filename) => {
  return new File([blob], filename, { type: blob.type });
};

// Example function to upload audio using HTTP or sockets
export const uploadAudioFile = async (blob, filename) => {
  try {
    const audioFile = blobToFile(blob, filename);
    // e.g., call your uploadAudio(...) from api.js
    // or use socket.io to emit the blob to the server
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in uploadAudioFile:', error);
    throw error;
  }
